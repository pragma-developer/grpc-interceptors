# grpc-interceptors
This GitHub repo is all about gRPC interceptors. We've got some cool examples for you to check out, covering server-side and client-side interceptors for stuff like authentication, logging, error handling, and more. These samples will give you a good idea of how to integrate interceptors into your gRPC projects and teach you some best practices for adding custom behaviors to your gRPC apps. Enjoy!
